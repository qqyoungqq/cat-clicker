## Cat Clicker application - premium pro version 
Mini project of Udacity course "JavaScript Design Patterns"

### Project Overview
The application is build on MVC frame

The application should display:
* a list of cats by name
* an area to display the selected cat
* an admin button
* an admin area with inputs for changing the cat's name, url, and number of clicks (hidden by default)

In the cat display area, the following should be displayed:
* the cat's name
* a picuture of the cat 
* text showing the number of clicks

### Instructions on how to run the application

* Click a cat name in the list to select a cat.  The cat display area will update to show the data for the selected cat.
* Click the cat's picture. The number of clicks for that cat should increment. 
* Click the admin button. The admin area should appear with the inputs filled in for the currently-selected cat.
* Click the cancel button in the admin area. The admin area should disappear. 
* Change the inputs in the admin area and and then click the save button.  The currently-selected cat's values update with the values in the admin area, and the admin area should disappear.
