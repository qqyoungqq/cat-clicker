## Cat Clicker application 
Mini project of Udacity course "JavaScript Design Patterns"

### Project Overview
The application should display:
* a list of at least 5 cats, listed by name
* an area to display the selected cat

In the cat display area, the following should be displayed:
* the cat's name
* a picuture of the cat 
* text showing the number of clicks

### Instructions on how to run the application
* Visit my Github page (http://qqyoungqq.github.io/cat-clicker/).
* Click a cat name in the list to select a cat.  The cat display area will update to show the data for the selected cat.
* Click the cat's picture. The number of clicks for that cat should increment.
